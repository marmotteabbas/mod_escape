This files describes API changes in the escape code.

=== 3.4 ===

* External function mod_escape_external::get_user_attempt() now returns the full page object inside each answerpages.

=== 3.3.2 ===

* escape_refresh_events() Now takes two additional parameters to refine the update to a specific instance. This function
  now optionally takes the module instance object or ID, and the course module object or ID. Please try to send the full
  objects instead of the ids to save DB calls.

=== 3.3 ===

* escape::callback_on_view() has an additional optional parameter $redirect default to true.
  It can be set to false to avoid redirection and return the page to redirect.
=== 3.1 ===
* Removed the unused file reformat.php
* removedoublecr() and importmodifiedaikenstyle() have now been removed.

=== 3.0 ===
* Removed broken high score code.  Use the activity results block instead.

=== 2.9 ===
* The  grade_item_delete function in mod/escape/lib.php was removed because it was not doing anything and was never called.
* A third optional boolean parameter $endreached was added to escape::update_timer to indicate that end of escape was reached. This is used by 'completionendreached' custom completion rule.
* escape_page_type_endofbranch::update in mod/escape/pagetypes/endofbranch.php
  and escape_page_type_endofcluster::update in mod/escape/pagetypes/endofcluster.php
  have been removed, this is now handled by the base class: escape_page::update in
  locallib.php and the exact same code is executed (it is also executed by the
  escape_page_type_cluster class that previously had no update function).
* A fourth parameter (format) has been added to the add_answer() function
  located as part of the escape_add_page_form_base class. If specified with a value of 'ESCAPE_ANSWER_HTML'
  then a rich html editor is generated. Otherwise an editor is created with Moodle Auto Format
* removedoublecr() and importmodifiedaikenstyle() are now deprecated.
* Added support for groups and groupings. If enabled, this allows the Report and
  Grade Essay view to be filtered by a group
